# About Me
<hr>
I'm a Ph.D. student at the University at Buffalo working with Dr. Karthik Dantu at DRONES Lab. Currently, I am also teaching the CSE568 course at UB. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of motion planning, control and robot learning. I am working on unifying these by leveraging the knowledge from classical techniques as priors for learning based approaches.
